## Exploratory Data Analysis</br>
Exercise in learning and applying one of three approved analysis tests to analyze a dataset: including the t-test, ANOVA, and Chi-Square, as well as how to use the
analysis tests and when to use each test.
Additionally created univariate and bivariate plots to interpret the distributions and results

## Multiple Linear Regression</br>
Built and compared multiple linear regression models with __statsmodels__ package to assess how multiple variables affect the quantitative numeric response variable at the same time. Used primary component analysis and variance inflation factors to determine variables of interest.

## Multiple Logistic Regression</br>
Built and compared multiple logistic regression models with __statsmodels__ package to assess how multiple variables affect the binary categorical response variable at the same time. Used primary component analysis and variance inflation factors to determine variables of interest.

## Decision tree regression</br>
Built and evaluated a regression tree with __scikit-learn__ packages including a training/test split of the data, as well as communicated the model building decisions, results, and limitations.

## K-nearest neighbors Classification Analysis</br>
Built and evaluated a KNN classification model with __scikit-learn__ packages including a training/test split of the data, as well as communicated the model building decisions, results, and limitations.
