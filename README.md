### Association Rules and Risk Analysis</br>
Used market basket analysis and the apriori algorithm's 3 parameters within __mlxtend and tensorflow__ packages to support the finding of the most frequently bought itemsets within a dataset recording customer purchases.

### Sentiment analysis</br>
Used sentiment analysis via __tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn__ packages to create a recurrent neural network model that can process user reviews from 3 datasets and accurately quantify a customer's sentiment as positive or negative.

### ARIMA Time-series analysis</br>
Built ARIMA analysis models with __statsmodels__ packages to support the finding of time-based trends within the past two years of revenue data and accurately forecast future daily revenue for the next three months.

### K-nearest neighbors Classification Analysis</br>
Built and evaluated a KNN classification model with __scikit-learn__ packages including a training/test split of the data, as well as communicated the model building decisions, results, and limitations.

### Decision tree regression</br>
Built and evaluated a regression tree with __scikit-learn__ packages including a training/test split of the data, as well as communicated the model building decisions, results, and limitations.

### Multiple Logistic Regression</br>
Built and compared multiple logistic regression models with __statsmodels__ package to assess how multiple variables affect the binary categorical response variable at the same time. Used primary component analysis and variance inflation factors to determine variables of interest.

### Exploratory Data Analysis</br>
Exercise in learning and applying one of three approved analysis tests to analyze a dataset: including the __t-test, ANOVA, and Chi-Square__, as well as how to use the
analysis tests and when to use each test. Additionally created univariate and bivariate plots to interpret the distributions and results
